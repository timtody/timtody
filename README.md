# Hi there 👋, I'm Julius!
I’m a Senior Cloud Engineer & Head of Data & AI at Thinkport (Frankfurt).
I lead our data & AI division, where I help clients design and scale modern data platforms and machine learning systems.

My work sits at the intersection of cloud engineering, AI and product building. My team and I build data platforms, responsible AI frameworks and ML-powered platforms.

## What I’m working on at Thinkport
- Building end-to-end Machine Learning platforms like [SIMPL](https://thinkport.digital/simpl-aws-machine-learning-fur-bayer/)
- Delivering large-scale data platform projects (Spark, Kubernetes, Airflow, Snowflake)
- Exploring responsible AI governance & agent architectures
- Growing a [data engineering team]([https://thinkport.netlify.app/solutions/data-platforms/](https://thinkport.netlify.app/kompetenzen/data-und-ai/) and shaping Thinkport’s AI strategy

## What I'm working on otherwise
- I'm learning rust!

## What is timtody?
Timtody (from Perl’s motto “TMTOWTDI”) is basically the idea that in Perl there are a million ways to solve the same problem. I don't know any Perl, luckily.
